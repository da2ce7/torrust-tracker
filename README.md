## Getting Started

### Container Version

The Torrust Tracker is [deployed to DockerHub][dockerhub_torrust_tracker], you can run a demo immediately with the following commands:

#### Docker:

```sh
docker run -it torrust/tracker:develop
```
> Please read our [container guide][containers.md] for more information.

#### Podman:

```sh
podman run -it torrust/tracker:develop
```
> Please read our [container guide][containers.md] for more information.

### Development Version

- Please assure you have the ___[latest stable (or nightly) version of rust][rust]___.
- Please assure that you computer has enough ram. ___Recommended 16GB.___

#### Checkout, Test and Run:

```sh
# Checkout repository into a new folder:
git clone https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker.git

# Change into directory and create a empty database file:
cd torrust-tracker
mkdir -p ./storage/tracker/lib/database/
touch ./storage/tracker/lib/database/sqlite3.db

# Check all tests in application:
cargo test --tests --benches --examples --workspace --all-targets --all-features

# Run the tracker:
cargo run
```
#### Customization:

```sh
# Copy the default configuration into the standard location:
mkdir -p ./storage/tracker/etc/
cp ./share/default/config/tracker.development.sqlite3.toml ./storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml

# Customize the tracker configuration (for example):
vim ./storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml

# Run the tracker with the updated configuration:
TORRUST_TRACKER_PATH_CONFIG="./storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml" cargo run
```

_Optionally, you may choose to supply the entire configuration as an environmental variable:_

```sh
# Use a configuration supplied on an environmental variable:
TORRUST_TRACKER_CONFIG=$(cat "./storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml") cargo run
```

_For deployment you __should__ override the `api_admin_token` by using an environmental variable:_

```sh
# Generate a Secret Token:
gpg --armor --gen-random 1 10 | tee ./storage/tracker/lib/tracker_api_admin_token.secret
chmod go-rwx ./storage/tracker/lib/tracker_api_admin_token.secret

# Override secret in configuration using an environmental variable:
TORRUST_TRACKER_CONFIG=$(cat "./storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml") \
  TORRUST_TRACKER_API_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(cat "./storage/tracker/lib/tracker_api_admin_token.secret") \
  cargo run
```

> Please view our [crate documentation][documentation] for more detailed instructions.
